Streamline your IPTV experience by consolidating multiple M3U playlists into a single source with the blazingly fast üî• and lightweight M3U Stream Merger Proxy. This service acts as a modern HTTP proxy server, effortlessly merging and streaming MP4 content from various M3U sources.

If you're tired of managing multiple IPTV connections with separate but identical M3U links, this proxy is the solution you need. Only MP4 streams are supported for now. Please open an issue to request a different type of stream and explain your use case.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization and M3U Playlist Consolidation:**
   - The service loads M3U playlists from specified URLs, consolidating streams into `/playlist.m3u`.
   - The consolidation process merges streams based on their names and saves them in a database.
   - Each unique stream name aggregates corresponding URLs into the consolidated playlist.

2. **HTTP Endpoints:**
   - **Playlist Endpoint (`/playlist.m3u`):**
     - Access the merged M3U playlist containing streams from different sources.

   - **Stream Endpoint (`/stream/{streamID}.mp4`):**
     - Request MP4 streams for specific stream IDs.

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - The service employs load balancing by cycling through available stream URLs.
   - Users can set max concurrency per stream URLs for optimized performance.

4. **Periodic Updates:**
   - Refreshes M3U playlists at specified intervals (cron schedule syntax) to ensure up-to-date stream information.
   - Updates run in the background with no downtime.

5. **Proxy Functionality:**
   - Abstracts complexity for clients, allowing interaction with a single endpoint.
   - Aggregates streams behind the scenes for a seamless user experience.

6. **Customization:**
   - Modify M3U URLs, update intervals, and other configurations in the `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.
- M3U URLs containing a playlist of MP4 streams.

## Docker Compose

Deploy with ease using the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  m3u-stream-merger-proxy:
    image: sonroyaalmerol/m3u-stream-merger-proxy:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data # OPTIONAL: only if you want the M3U generated to persist across restarts
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Toronto
      - SYNC_ON_BOOT=true
      - SYNC_CRON=0 0 * * *
      - M3U_URL_1=https://iptvprovider1.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_1=2
      - M3U_URL_2=https://iptvprovider2.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_2=1
      - M3U_URL_X=
    restart: always
```

Access the generated M3U playlist at `http://<server ip>:8080/playlist.m3u`.
